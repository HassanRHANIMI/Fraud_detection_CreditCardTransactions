It's a Data Science practice project with Python

--------------Fraudulent credit card transactions detection--------------------------- 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a data scientist working for a data analytics firm.  
                         
Your firm has tasked you to train several models and evaluate how effectively         
they predict instances of fraudulent credit card transactions using data based 
on a dataset from Kaggle.

the data are given in the "fraud_data.csv" file. Each row corresponds to a credit 
card transaction. Features include confidential variables V1 through V28 
as well as 'Amount' which is the amount of the transaction.

The target is stored in the 'class' column, where a value of 1 corresponds to an 
instance of fraud and 0 corresponds to an instance of not fraud.

the diffrent steps taken are indicated in the ipython file
